# egg-os
if you think of a better name tell me because I suck at names.
the folder is named os becuause that is what I was calling it because im bad names and it will be hard to change all paths but I will later.
most of this won't work but I will fix it at some point most of it is the path being wrong.
put the os file in c:\\ and nothing else or it won't work.
for it to run you need to pip install pyttsx3,pyautogui,and keyboard.
also it will only work on windows
